Now the real experiment will start.

Try to perform as best as you can: the higher your accuracy, the more money

You will go through 6 blocks of 50 trials. You can take a break in between.

Remember:
    - Press 'F' to choose the left answer.
    - Press 'J' to choose the right answer.
    - The letters will stay in the same location for the whole experiment.
    - The response deadline is 2 seconds.

Please call the experimenter if you have any questions.
    
Good luck!
