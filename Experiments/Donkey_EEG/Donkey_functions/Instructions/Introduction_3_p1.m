Now you've got the donkeys to yourself. Try and collect as many coins
as possible. The more coins you collect, the more money you will receive 
at the end of the experiment.

You will no longer be forced to make a choice on half of the trials,
every trial you can make a decision yourself.

Remember:
    - All donkeys return coins, but some more frequently than others.
    - Use 'F' and 'J' keys to choose the left and right box resp.
    - 'A' refers to the first donkey and 'B' to the second.
    - The letters in the boxes will randomly switch places between trials.
    
Please call the experiment now if you have any questions.
