- On every trial, you will see 2 donkeys with different colours.
- Half of the time, you cannot choose freely and this will be indicated
    with a coloured frame around the animal and the response box.
    => this is completely at random and does NOT indicate the best option!
    
- How you choose after you've seen the two options:
    -> There will be two response boxes with a letter inside.
    -> 'A' refers to the first donkey you've seen.
       'B' refers to the second donkey you've seen.
    -> The letters in the boxes will randomly switch places between trials!
- You make a choice by pressing 'F' and 'J' to choose the left and right box.

- If you haven't decided after 2 seconds, you won't have any outcome.
- In this part, your performance will NOT yet lead to monetary reward.
    
If you have any questions, please call the experimenter.
